               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Welcome to this stunning 3 level, 5000 sq. ft., 8 bedroom cottage situated on 1.5 acres of land on 3 Mile Lake. The owners have been on the lake for over 50 years. As the family grew, they bought and built this stunning cottage!

As you enter the cottage from the driveway entrance and pass through the welcoming foyer to the main living area, you are immediately drawn into fantastic views of the lake from a two-storey wall of floor to ceiling windows. With gorgeous hardwood floors throughout, open concept kitchen/dining/living room and soaring cathedral ceilings, a feeling of warmth and spaciousness abounds.

The designer kitchen is a gourmet chef’s delight with a inducation stove, farmers sink, custom cabinets and quartz counters. Preparing and making meals will be a joy with plenty of space to be creative in while taking in peaceful lake views through the dining room windows.

The valtled ceiling living room, with its comfortable furnishings, large screen TV and an impressive stone floor to ceiling fireplace will be the place to settle into and relax after dinner.

The master bedroom, just off of the living room, is an oasis onto itself. Its tastefully appointed décor, wood floors, cathedral ceilings, an abundance of windows and a 5-piece ensuite bathroom, complete with a clawfoot bathtub, make for a great escape after a long day of cottage vacation activity. A private deck off of the front of the bedroom offers a perfect place for early morning coffees or late night beverages while taking in beautiful views of the lake.</p><p></p><p>

The upper level has a large bedroom with a 3-piece ensuite and the remaining 3 bedrooms are on the lower level, 2 having their own 3-piece ensuites. Rounding out the lower level is a lake facing family room with a walk-out to a stone patio.

The great outdoors will certainly be your playground while you are here! Step out onto a two-tiered deck, down to the stone patio and on to the sprawling lawn, great for ball and Frisbee throwing, that gently slopes down to a lakeside deck with steps down to the dock and 250 feet of waterfront.

The hard-packed rippled sand shoreline is easily accessed by 3 steps and is the perfect spot for the younger ones to safely splash and play. The dock is expansive and the depth at the end is over 6 feet making it ideal for the older kids to jump from and cool off in the refreshing clear water. While away the hours soaking up the sun or take out the kayaks to explore the lake.

Lake of Bays is the second largest lake in the Muskokas and is known for its fabulous swimming, fishing and boating. With numerous marinas and public boat launches nearby, you could bring your own boat or rent a boat to enjoy all that the lake has to offer. With over 165 km of shoreline you should definitely indulge in a boating day trip or two to the villages of Dorset, Dwight and Baysville. Dorset has a fantastic lookout tower and Robinson’s General Store (along with other local shops and eateries), Dwight has a great market, beach and Henrietta's Bakery and Baysville has a Farmers market on Friday afternoons and Lake of Bays Brewery. Another must in season would be a trip to historic Bigwin Island for a day of golf and there is also the LOB tennis and sailing club, great for both kids and adults.

End your days back at the cottage with a delicious BBQ on the deck, play a game of pool or ping pong and then catch the beautiful sunsets on the dock with your favourite after dinner beverage. When the sky fills with stars as you roast your marshmallows around the fire pit, city life will be a distant memory! It just doesn’t get much better!
